# Technical Decision Log

## Overview

This document records the key technical decisions made during the development of the Etomovich Journal App, outlining the problem addressed, options considered, chosen approach, and trade-offs.

## Decisions

### 1. Framework and Architecture

- **Decision:** Use Next.js (v15.2.4) with the new App Router.
- **Options Considered:** Next.js vs. Remix vs. other full-stack frameworks.
- **Rationale:** Next.js provides robust server-side capabilities, API routes, and excellent community support.
- **Trade-offs:** Learning curve with the new App Router; however, the benefits in terms of performance and scalability outweigh the challenges.

### 2. Authentication

- **Decision:** Implement authentication using NextAuth with both Google OAuth and credentials providers.
- **Options Considered:** Custom JWT authentication, Firebase Auth.
- **Rationale:** NextAuth simplifies multi-provider authentication and integrates well with Prisma.
- **Trade-offs:** Requires proper configuration of JWT callbacks and managing dependencies; overall, it significantly speeds up development.

### 3. Database & ORM

- **Decision:** Use PostgreSQL with Prisma as the ORM.
- **Options Considered:** MySQL, MongoDB.
- **Rationale:** PostgreSQL's relational structure fits our data model; Prisma offers a type-safe, modern API.
- **Trade-offs:** Prisma migrations require careful management; however, the benefits in maintainability and type safety are significant.

### 4. UI/UX and Styling

- **Decision:** Use Tailwind CSS combined with ShadCN-inspired component design.
- **Options Considered:** Material-UI, Styled Components.
- **Rationale:** Tailwind provides a utility-first approach for rapid styling and custom design, while ShadCN principles offer clean, modern UI patterns.
- **Trade-offs:** Initial setup and learning curve; results in a highly customizable and responsive design.

### 5. AI Integration

- **Decision:** Integrate AI features using the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis, theme extraction, and writing suggestions.
- **Options Considered:** Local NLP libraries, other cloud AI services.
- **Rationale:** OpenAI offers state-of-the-art models and a straightforward API integration.
- **Trade-offs:** Dependency on external API usage and cost management; fallback and error handling are implemented for quota issues.

### 6. Analytics & Visualization

- **Decision:** Use Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 for visualizing journal data.
- **Options Considered:** Recharts, D3.js.
- **Rationale:** Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 provides a balance of ease-of-use and flexibility for visualizing aggregated data.
- **Trade-offs:** Customization might be less granular compared to D3.js; however, it accelerates development.
